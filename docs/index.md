# CORDEX simulations status

These are different views of the CORDEX-CMIP6 simulations status:

 * [Full list of simulations](CMIP6_downscaling_plans.html)
 * [Summary by domain](CORDEX_CMIP6_status.html)
 * [Summary by scenario](CORDEX_CMIP6_status_by_scenario.html)
 * [Summary by experiment](CORDEX_CMIP6_status_by_experiment.html)

They are generated from [CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/simulation-status/blob/main/CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv), which collects the plans from the different groups as gathered in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jy53yvB9SDOiWcwKRJc_HpWVgmjxZhy-qVviHl6ymDM/edit?usp=sharing).

Check out also the CORDEX-CMIP5 simulations available on ESGF, either as [GCM-RCM matrices by scenario] (CORDEX_CMIP5_status_by_scenario.html) or an [interactive list](CORDEX_CMIP5_list.html).
