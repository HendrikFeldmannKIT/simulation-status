CORDEX simulation status
========================
This repository stores a machine-readable version ([CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv](./CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv)) of the CORDEX CMIP6 downscaling plans by the modelling groups as gathered in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jy53yvB9SDOiWcwKRJc_HpWVgmjxZhy-qVviHl6ymDM/edit?usp=sharing). It also renders the information formatted as HTML tables (see https://wcrp-cordex.github.io/simulation-status).
